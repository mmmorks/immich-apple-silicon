# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Internal
- **Static-analysis stack.** Added [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) linting + formatting and [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) type-checking for the CLI (`pyproject.toml`), plus gitleaks secret scanning, Dependabot, and pre-commit hooks; all wired into CI. The `ml/` submodule gets the same ruff config and pre-commit/Dependabot setup (its pyright + tests stay local, since they need the native mlx/cv2 venv). No user-facing behavior change.

## 1.5.3 — 2026-06-03

### Fixes
- **Fix root-owned files from Docker containers (#52)**. Fresh installs now offer to run the Immich server container as the current user, preventing root-owned files in bind-mounted directories. Contributed by [@hiisukun](https://github.com/hiisukun).
- **Graceful uninstall when root-owned files exist**. `uninstall` now explains the problem and suggests `sudo rm -rf` instead of crashing with a raw PermissionError.
- **Fix `/etc/synthetic.d` permissions**. A tight root umask could leave the directory unsearchable by non-root users, breaking the `/build` firmlink check.
- **Compose project named "immich"**. Was defaulting to "docker" (the parent directory name).

## 1.5.2 — 2026-06-02

### Fixes
- **Fix watchdog spawning duplicate workers (#51)**. Immich 2.7+ sets `process.title='immich'`, so the parent node PID exits while child processes keep running. PID tracking now falls back to scanning for live `immich` processes, preventing the watchdog from spawning duplicates. Stop also kills all orphaned immich processes.

## 1.5.1 — 2026-05-25

### Fixes
- **HEVC VideoToolbox output now always uses Apple-compatible hvc1 tag (#48)**. ffmpeg defaults to hev1 for HEVC, which Apple's decoder rejects. The wrapper now injects `-tag:v hvc1` when encoding HEVC via VideoToolbox if the caller doesn't specify it.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-05-19

### Features
- **One-command fresh install.** `immich-accelerator setup` on a bare Mac now sets up everything — installs OrbStack if no Docker is found, creates the Immich Docker stack, configures the native worker, and starts all services. Two questions: where your photos are, where Immich should store its data. No manual docker-compose editing.
- **Managed Docker stack.** The generated compose file lives at `~/.immich-accelerator/docker/`. Re-running setup detects it and restarts if stopped, without re-prompting.

## 1.4.13 — 2026-05-18

### Fixes
- **UHDR JPEG thumbnails failing (#44)**. Sharp was building from source against system libvips which has a UHDR loader that breaks JPEG auto-detect. Now installs the official pre-built darwin-arm64 binary from npm, which bundles vips 8.17.3 without the UHDR loader. Matches stock Immich Docker behavior. Existing installs: `immich-accelerator setup` to trigger a rebuild.

## 1.4.12 — 2026-05-16

### Fixes
- **Startup validates database and Redis connections with real queries (#42)**. Instead of just checking TCP connectivity, the preflight now runs `psql SELECT 1` and `redis-cli PING`. Surfaces the actual error (auth failure, port conflict, connection reset) with actionable guidance instead of letting the worker crash with a raw ECONNRESET.
- **Auto-creates missing media subdirectories on startup (#43)**. If `upload/`, `thumbs/`, `encoded-video/`, etc. are missing under `IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION`, the preflight creates them with `.immich` markers so Immich's StorageService doesn't crash.

## 1.4.11 — 2026-04-27

### Improvements
- **Environment preflight checks on start.** Auto-detects and fixes common issues before launching the worker: ImageMagick HEIC codec (auto-reinstalls), NFS mount accessibility, DB/Redis connectivity for split setups. Runs silently when everything is healthy.

## 1.4.10 — 2026-04-25

### Fixes
- **CLIP/smart search crashes on MLX 0.31.2 (#38)**. MLX 0.31.2 introduced a threading regression that crashes with "no Stream(gpu, 0)" during CLIP inference. Pinned `mlx<0.31.2` until upstream fixes it. Existing installs: `brew reinstall immich-accelerator`.
- **ML submodule updated** with face embedding batch-dim fallback, CLIP model-swap retry, and gpu_lock clarification from upstream code review.

## 1.4.9 — 2026-04-23

### Fixes
- **iPhone 15+ Ultra HDR images failed thumbnail generation (#36)**. Sharp was using a pre-packaged binary without libultrahdr support. Now builds from source against Homebrew's libvips which includes it. Existing installs: run `immich-accelerator setup` to trigger a rebuild.

## 1.4.8 — 2026-04-18

### Improvements
- **Dashboard shows worker memory usage.** "Microservices Worker (450 MB)" next to the service status so memory growth during long thumbnail runs is visible (#33).
- **Human-readable API error messages.** Dashboard now shows specific messages for common failures (auth rejected, connection refused, timeout, empty response) instead of raw Python exceptions.

## 1.4.7 — 2026-04-17

### Fixes
- **Homebrew formula failed to install on every release since v1.4.4 (#31)**. The CI workflow that generates the formula used a bash heredoc containing backticks and em-dashes. Backticks triggered command substitution on the runner, em-dashes got mangled through the locale. Brew's Ruby installer rejected the resulting invalid UTF-8. Replaced with plain ASCII.

## 1.4.6 — 2026-04-16

### Fixes
- **ML service silently failed to start after brew upgrade (#29)**. Config stored a versioned Cellar path for `ml_dir` which gets deleted on upgrade. `cmd_start` and `cmd_watch` now auto-resolve `ml_dir` via the stable `/opt/homebrew/opt/` symlink on every run. Warns loudly when the ML venv is missing instead of silently skipping.
- **Dashboard showed "Idle" while Immich was processing (#28)**. The `/api/jobs` call had a 2s timeout that caused intermittent failures under load, and errors were silently swallowed. Dashboard now shows the actual error when the API is unreachable, displays queue counts matching Immich's admin panel, and bumps the timeout to 5s.

## 1.4.5 — 2026-04-15

### Fixes
- **Database backups were silently 0 bytes (#24)**. Immich pipes `pg_dump` through `gzip --rsyncable`, which Apple's BSD gzip doesn't support. `pg_dump_shim.js` now reroutes those calls to Homebrew's GNU gzip (or strips the flag as fallback). The formula now `depends_on "gzip"` so fresh installs get GNU gzip automatically.
- **Watchdog could kill unrelated processes**. `_kill_stale_processes` matched any command line containing the substring `immich`. Replaced with precise patterns for the canonical worker (`node … dist/main.js`) and ML service (`python -m src.main`) launch shapes.

### Test infrastructure
- **Isolated E2E Immich stack** (`scripts/e2e-stack.yml` + `e2e-stack.sh`). Dedicated postgres / redis / api-only Immich server on port-shifted loopback addresses with throwaway state. The VM harness now requires this stack and refuses to run against prod Immich.
- **Real-data backup integration test** that runs `pg_dump | gzip --rsyncable` through the shim against the isolated Postgres and asserts the output is a valid non-empty pg_dump.

## 1.4.4 — 2026-04-14

### Fixes
- **Homebrew formula pulled node 25, breaking sharp on every fresh install**: v1.4.x shipped with `depends_on "node"` in the generated formula. Homebrew's default `node` formula tracks mainline (currently 25.x), but Immich 2.7.x pins `engines.node = 24.14.1` and `sharp@0.34.5`'s native addons fail to load on node 25 with a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch. Every fresh `brew install immich-accelerator` + `immich-accelerator start` hit an opaque worker crash at `require('sharp')` mid-Nest-bootstrap that looked like an Immich bug. Fix: pin `depends_on "node@22"` in the formula template and teach `find_node()` to look under `/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin/node` (keg-only — no `/opt/homebrew/bin` symlink).
- **`find_node()` accepted unsupported node majors silently**: previously it returned the first `node` binary it found, regardless of version. Now filters to `SUPPORTED_NODE_MAJORS = (22, 24)` and installs `node@22` if nothing compatible is present.
- **`_rebuild_sharp()` swallowed rebuild failures**: logged `log.error` and returned, letting the worker start and crash later with an unrelated-looking stack. Now raises `RuntimeError` with the rebuild stderr tail and a remediation pointing at `brew install node@22`.

### Upgrade resilience (catches future drift)
- **Node preflight in `start`**: every `immich-accelerator start` now re-resolves node via `find_node()`, updates `config["node"]` if the path changed, and compares against Immich's `engines.node` parsed from `package.json`. Catches the `brew upgrade` drift pattern where node silently jumps majors and breaks sharp, with a clear "install node@22" error before the worker ever spawns.
- **Sharp load preflight in `start`**: spawns `node -e "require('sharp')"` against the server dir. If it fails, auto-attempts a rebuild and retries. If the retry still fails, hard-errors with remediation. This turns "opaque worker crash 10+ seconds into Nest bootstrap" into a 1-second clearly-labeled check.

### Test coverage
- `tests/test_fresh_install.py::TestNodeVersionPreflight` — 11 new unit tests covering `_node_major_version`, `find_node` version filtering, `_check_node_engines_compat` with real stubbed node binaries, `_verify_sharp_loads` error reporting, and a static check that the CI-generated Homebrew formula pins `node@22`.
- `scripts/e2e-fresh-install.sh` step 1b — asserts `find_node()` on a real VM returns a node in `SUPPORTED_NODE_MAJORS`. Would have caught the v1.4.x regression on the first E2E run.
- `scripts/e2e-fresh-install.sh` step 3b — runs the full sharp preflight (`_check_node_engines_compat` + `_verify_sharp_loads`) against the extracted Immich server in the VM.
- `scripts/e2e-fresh-install.sh` steps 9–16 — **real execution coverage**: start ML in `STUB_MODE`, hit `/ping` + `/health` + `/predict` for actual JSON render (catches any `ORJSONResponse` regression), run `immich-accelerator ml-test` against the stub, verify the `NODE_OPTIONS` pg_dump shim actually loads in a real node process, start the real worker and wait for the `Immich Microservices is running` Nest-bootstrap marker, run the dashboard against the live worker and confirm `worker.alive=true`, verify the `status` subcommand reports the running PID, verify `stop` cleanly terminates + is idempotent, verify a second `start` after `stop` reaches Nest bootstrap again.
- `scripts/e2e-bootstrap-vm.sh` — installs `node@22` instead of Homebrew-default `node`, sets up the `/build` synthetic firmlink via dual `/etc/synthetic.d/` + `/etc/synthetic.conf` entries (some macOS VM images only honor the legacy location), reboots the VM to activate the firmlink, and verifies `/build` resolves post-reboot before saving the base snapshot. pip install now retries 3× on VM DNS flakes.

## 1.4.3 — 2026-04-14

### Fixes
- **NODE_OPTIONS shim path broken in v1.4.2 (#24 follow-up)**: The v1.4.2 commit that "polished" the pg_dump shim wrapping wrapped the path in single quotes, thinking Node would unquote them. Node doesn't — it splits `NODE_OPTIONS` on whitespace and takes the literal characters. The quotes became part of the filename and every worker start failed with `Cannot find module ''/opt/homebrew/Cellar/…/pg_dump_shim.js''`. Fix: wrap the path in **double** quotes, which is the only form Node's `NODE_OPTIONS` tokenizer honors universally (single quotes and backslash escapes both fail — both verified empirically against Node 25.2). Verified end-to-end against a real v1.4.2 brew install on an M4 Mac — shim loads, `pg_dump (PostgreSQL) 18.3` runs.
- **ORJSONResponse crash in ML service (#20 tail)**: The v1.3.4 commit dropped `orjson` from `ml/requirements.txt` with an incorrect commit message claiming "not imported by our code." `main.py` imports `ORJSONResponse` from `fastapi.responses` and uses it in 3 places, and FastAPI's `ORJSONResponse.render()` asserts `orjson is not None` at render time — every `/predict` request crashed with `AssertionError: orjson must be installed to use ORJSONResponse`. Fix: swap to stdlib-backed `JSONResponse`, keeping the `orjson` drop (which was correct — its wheel broke Homebrew's dylib fixup). Verified end-to-end: ml-test passes 4/4 on real CLIP + OCR requests with no orjson in the venv.

### Regression guards (test coverage the v1.4.2 VM E2E didn't have)
- Static check: `ml/src` uses `ORJSONResponse` only if `ml/requirements.txt` pins `orjson` — would have caught the v1.3.4 half-fix instantly.
- Real-node integration: generate the exact `NODE_OPTIONS` string `cmd_start` builds, spawn `node --require` against a sentinel shim, assert it loads. Would have caught the v1.4.2 quoting bug before merge.
- Static check: `cmd_start`'s shim-path escaping uses backslash form, not shell quoting.

## 1.4.2 — 2026-04-13

### Fixes
- **Path-mismatch probe false positive (#19 follow-up)**: The v1.4.1 split-setup probe queried `/api/libraries` as its primary signal, but that endpoint only returns **external** libraries in Immich 2.7+ — the upload library (where web-UI uploads land) is implicit at `IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION` and doesn't appear there. Result: any install with an external library plus a correctly-set `upload_mount` got blocked at `immich-accelerator start` with a false "path mismatch" error. The probe now parses an upload-library asset's `originalPath` (filtering `libraryId: null`) and skips external-library assets entirely. If no upload assets exist yet, the check is skipped — nothing to compare against.
- **External library path validation**: The probe now also checks every external library's `importPath` against the Mac filesystem. Missing paths produce a non-fatal warning per library with the library name and guidance to mount or synthetic-link them. Upload-library mismatch remains fatal (thumbnails WILL 404), external-library inaccessibility is advisory (worker can still process uploads + any libraries whose paths do resolve).
- **pg_dump ENOENT on database backup (#24)**: Immich's `DatabaseBackupService` hardcodes `/usr/lib/postgresql/${version}/bin/pg_dump` in its dist, and on macOS that path doesn't exist, so the native microservices worker fails every backup cycle with ENOENT. `/usr/lib/` is SIP-protected and there's no env-var escape hatch in Immich's code. Fix: a tiny Node runtime shim (`immich_accelerator/hooks/pg_dump_shim.js`) that monkey-patches `child_process.spawn`/`spawnSync`/`execFile` to rewrite the Linux postgres client path to `/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin/` at call time. The shim is preloaded via `NODE_OPTIONS=--require …` when we launch the worker. **Immich's JS source on disk is never touched** — the same interposition pattern we already use for the ffmpeg wrapper, applied at the Node module layer. Verified end-to-end on a real Mac with node + libpq 18.3.

### Docs
- **Split deployment clarity**: Reworked the Split deployment section of the README to lead with the one requirement everyone needs to get right — both machines see the same files at the same absolute paths via a shared filesystem (NFS/SMB). There is no HTTP transport of thumbnails between hosts; the worker reads/writes directly to disk. Surfaced because a v1.4.1 user interpreted "match paths" as string matching. Also dropped the long-stale v0.x and v1.2.x migration sections.

### Test infrastructure
- **VM bootstrap script**: Fixed three edge cases that kept the tart-based E2E harness from running cleanly — trap composition bug that left stale VMs behind, stdin-race on heredoc-over-ssh that silently dropped pip install commands, and `brew update` network flakiness aborting bootstrap. The harness is now proven end-to-end against live Immich.

## 1.4.1 — 2026-04-12

### Fresh-install fixes
- **Dashboard ModuleNotFoundError** (#17): Homebrew formula wrapper now runs the CLI under the ML venv's Python instead of stock `python@3.11`. The dashboard's lazy `fastapi`/`uvicorn` imports now resolve on any fresh Mac — previously they only worked if the user happened to have the packages installed globally. Also added a `brew test` block that force-loads `dashboard.create_app` so this class of bug gets caught at audit time, not in the wild.
- **Missing corePlugin on OCI download** (#18): Re-fix of a regression from the v1.3.3 fix. The layer loop had a `size_mb < 1` early-break shortcut that fired *before* examining the current layer — stranding the tiny corePlugin COPY layer. Replaced with a version-aware break (`_has_everything`) that requires `corePlugin/manifest.json` for Immich 2.7+. Verified end-to-end against a live ghcr.io pull.

### Test coverage
- Added `tests/test_fresh_install.py` — unit tests for the layer-break logic, a static check that `fastapi`/`uvicorn` stay pinned in `ml/requirements.txt`, an AST check that `dashboard.py` has no top-level third-party imports, and a slow integration test that builds a pristine venv and confirms `create_app` works with only `fastapi`+`uvicorn` installed.
- **CI now runs on macOS 14** (Apple Silicon) in addition to Ubuntu. The `fresh-install-macos` job catches "works on my machine" bugs before shipping.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-04-09

- **libpq as Homebrew dependency**: `psql` now installed automatically via `depends_on "libpq"` in the formula — works for both new installs and upgrades, not just setup.
- **Published GitHub releases**: Releases are now published automatically (not draft).

## 1.3.9 — 2026-04-09

- **Draft GitHub releases**: Merging to main now creates a draft GitHub release with changelog notes and upgrade instructions. Review and publish when ready.

## 1.3.8 — 2026-04-09

- **Dashboard DB connectivity**: Dashboard now logs clear errors when it can't reach Postgres (missing psql, wrong port binding, unreachable host) instead of silently showing empty data.
- **Setup installs libpq**: `psql` client installed automatically for dashboard DB queries. Previously only worked on same-machine setups via docker exec.
- **Port instructions**: Setup now suggests open port binding (`5432:5432`) instead of localhost-only (`127.0.0.1:5432:5432`), with a note to restrict if same-machine.

## 1.3.7 — 2026-04-08

- **Fully automated releases**: Merging to main now auto-tags and updates Homebrew formula — no manual steps.

## 1.3.6 — 2026-04-08

- **Homebrew formula fix**: Move ML pip install to `post_install` phase — fixes dylib fixup errors on all Rust-compiled Python extensions (pydantic_core, tokenizers, etc.), not just orjson.
- **CI workflow**: Formula template now generates `post_install` correctly so future releases don't regress.
- **Docs**: Clarify NAS+Mac path mapping with two concrete options — match Mac paths in Docker, or use macOS synthetic links to match Docker paths on Mac (zero Docker changes).

## 1.3.5 — 2026-04-08

### Bug fixes
- **jellyfin-ffmpeg auto-detect**: No longer hardcodes a specific version URL that 404s when upstream updates. Now parses the repo directory listing for the latest build.
- **Homebrew formula**: Move ML venv pip install to `post_install` phase to avoid Homebrew's dylib fixup errors on Rust-compiled Python extensions.
- **Cleanup**: Remove stale local formula copy (real formula lives in tap repo, auto-updated by CI).

## 1.3.4 — 2026-04-08

### Bug fixes
- **Homebrew install fix**: Drop `orjson` dependency — binary wheel broke Homebrew's dylib fixup. Not imported by our code; FastAPI uses stdlib json as fallback. Fixes #7.
- **Synthetic link migration**: Migrate legacy `/etc/synthetic.conf` entry to `/etc/synthetic.d/immich-accelerator`. Uninstall now cleans both locations.

## 1.3.3 — 2026-04-07

### Bug fixes
- **Plugin WASM paths**: Fix Immich 2.7+ crash in split-worker setups. Uses macOS synthetic firmlink (`/build` → `~/.immich-accelerator/build-data`) so both Docker and native workers resolve the same plugin paths. No database modifications. Setup prompts for sudo once; `uninstall` cleans it up.
- **OCI extraction**: Fix build data landing in wrong directory (`build/` instead of `build-data/`). Tar member paths are now rewritten during extraction.
- **Missing corePlugin**: OCI download no longer skips small image layers, so the corePlugin WASM (in its own Docker COPY layer) is always extracted.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-04-07

- Yanked — used direct DB manipulation for plugin path fix. Replaced by v1.3.3 firmlink approach.

## 1.3.1 — 2026-04-05

- **Homebrew install**: `brew tap epheterson/immich-accelerator && brew install immich-accelerator`. Installs deps, creates `immich-accelerator` command in PATH, supports `brew services start` for auto-launch.
- Formula at [epheterson/homebrew-immich-accelerator](https://github.com/epheterson/homebrew-immich-accelerator).

## 1.3.0 — 2026-04-04

### Module renamed
- `python3 -m immich_accelerator` (was `python3 -m accelerator`). Clearer what it is.

### One-command setup
- `git clone --recursive && cd && python3 -m immich_accelerator setup` does everything.
- Auto-installs: Homebrew, Node.js, libvips, Python 3.11, ML venv + dependencies, jellyfin-ffmpeg.
- Extracts server from Docker, rebuilds Sharp for macOS.
- Shows docker-compose changes, opens editor, retries connection until Docker is configured.
- Auto-starts worker + ML service after setup.
- Offers to install launchd services (worker + dashboard) for auto-start on login.
- Quick start reduced from 4 manual steps to: clone, setup, done.
- `uninstall` command: cleanly removes services, launchd config, accelerator data, and ML venv. Immich data and Docker untouched.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-04-04

- Setup offers to install Homebrew, Node.js, and libvips if missing. Zero manual prerequisites beyond Python 3.11.
- OrbStack Docker path detected automatically.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-04-04

- **jellyfin-ffmpeg**: Setup now downloads the same ffmpeg binary Immich uses in Docker (jellyfin-ffmpeg, macOS arm64). Includes `tonemapx` natively — HDR video thumbnails are now identical to Docker output. No more Homebrew ffmpeg patching or formula editing.
- **Simplified ffmpeg wrapper**: With jellyfin-ffmpeg handling `tonemapx` natively, the wrapper only remaps encoders to VideoToolbox. Reduced from 120 lines to 50.
- **Requirements simplified**: No longer need `brew install ffmpeg` or libwebp formula patching. Just Node.js, libvips, and Python 3.11+.
- **Known differences reduced**: ffmpeg row in the differences table now shows "Identical" — same binary, same filters, same output.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-04-04

### Dashboard
- Chip-as-card layout: each card represents a silicon unit (CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, VideoToolbox) with its tasks inside. Neural Engine shows Face Detection and OCR with individual progress bars and counts.
- Excludes hidden assets (Live Photo motion files) from progress — matches Immich's actual processing scope.
- Shows 100% when all processable assets are complete. Unprocessable files (corrupt, stubs) tracked as "skipped" instead of dragging percentage below 100%.
- Video Transcode shows "N transcoded" instead of misleading ratio against total videos.

### Housekeeping
- PLAN.md removed from repo (local planning doc, gitignored)
- Pre-push hook enforces VERSION > remote + CHANGELOG entry

## 1.1.0 — 2026-04-03

### Setup: remote and manual modes
- **Remote Immich** (`setup --url http://nas:2283 --api-key KEY`) — queries the Immich API for version, prompts for DB/Redis connection details. Docker on the Mac is optional — if available it pulls the image; if not, it guides you through extracting the server on your NAS and importing with `--import-server`.
- **Manual config** (`setup --manual`) — creates a config template at `~/.immich-accelerator/config.json` for direct editing. Full control, zero auto-discovery.
- **Server import** (`setup --import-server PATH`) — import server files from a directory or tarball extracted on a remote host. No Docker needed on the Mac.

### Web dashboard
- Real-time monitoring at `http://your-mac:8420` with live processing rates and ETAs
- Service health indicators (worker, ML, Docker)
- Re-queue Missing button (triggers all job queues via Immich API)
- Apple Silicon hardware utilization display
- Mobile-friendly layout

### FFmpeg fixes
- **libwebp encoder validation** — setup now checks for `libwebp`, `h264_videotoolbox`, and `hevc_videotoolbox` encoders. Without libwebp, all video thumbnails fail silently.
- **tonemapx → tonemap remap** — Immich's Docker ffmpeg (jellyfin-ffmpeg) has a custom `tonemapx` filter for HDR→SDR. Homebrew ffmpeg doesn't. The wrapper now remaps to upstream `tonemap` + `format` filters for HDR video thumbnails.
- **Two-pass -preset handling** — `-preset` is now correctly stripped for VideoToolbox regardless of argument order.
- **Debug logging** — ffmpeg wrapper logs rewritten commands to `~/.immich-accelerator/logs/ffmpeg-wrapper.log`.

### Fixes
- Sharp rebuilt against system libvips (Homebrew) instead of prebuilt darwin binaries. Handles corrupt HEIF files correctly, matching Docker's behavior.
- Stale process cleanup on `start` — kills orphaned immich/ML processes from previous runs.
- Dashboard uses config values for DB queries instead of hardcoding container/user/db names.
- `cmd_start` always uses config DB password (not stale Docker detection).
- `cmd_watch` uses `extract_immich_server` return value instead of reconstructing path.
- Rate calculations use `time.monotonic()` consistently (immune to NTP/DST clock adjustments).
- API key preserved across `setup` re-runs.
- Submodule pointer fixed (clone --recursive works).

### Documentation
- "Known differences from Docker" section in README — comprehensive table of every deviation from stock Immich.
- Split deployment (NAS + Mac) documentation updated for new setup modes.
- Dashboard section with screenshot.

### Both versions visible
- Dashboard header shows both "Accelerator v1.1.0" and "Immich v2.6.3" badges.
- VERSION file is single source of truth, read by both CLI and dashboard.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-04-01

Major rewrite. The project is now **Immich Accelerator** — runs Immich's own microservices worker natively on macOS instead of custom thumbnail/ffmpeg components.

### What's new
- **Native microservices worker** — Immich's own code extracted from Docker, run bare metal on macOS with full hardware access
- **VideoToolbox video transcoding** — ffmpeg wrapper remaps software encoders to hardware (h264_videotoolbox, hevc_videotoolbox). No Immich patches needed.
- **Accelerator CLI** — `setup`, `start`, `stop`, `status`, `watch`, `update`, `logs`
- **Container extract approach** — server copied from Docker image, always version-matched. Sharp native binary + libvips for HEIF swapped for macOS. No source builds.
- **IMMICH_MEDIA_LOCATION** — Immich's official env var for path mapping. Zero sudo.
- **Auto-update** — detects Immich version changes on start and re-extracts
- **Watchdog** — `watch` command monitors and auto-restarts crashed services
- **Metal concurrency** — shared gpu_lock serializes MLX CLIP (thread-safety bug in MLX), Vision framework runs lock-free on ANE
- **HEIF/HEIC support** — Sharp libvips darwin binary includes full format support

### Hardware utilization (M4 24GB)
| Silicon | Used for | Rate |
|---------|----------|------|
| Metal GPU | CLIP embeddings (MLX) | ~700/min |
| Neural Engine | Face detection + OCR (Vision) | ~200 + 700/min |
| VideoToolbox | Video encode/decode | Hardware-accelerated |
| CPU (NEON SIMD) | Thumbnails (Sharp/libvips) | ~400/min |
| CPU / CoreML | Face embedding (ONNX) | Lock-free, parallel |

### What's removed
- Custom thumbnail worker (replaced by Immich's own Sharp running natively)
- FFmpeg proxy and wrapper scripts (replaced by lightweight ffmpeg wrapper)
- Direct database writes for thumbnails (native worker uses Immich's own job pipeline)

### What's unchanged
- ML service (immich-ml-metal) — native ML via MACHINE_LEARNING_URL

### ML service updates
- Concurrent inference: CLIP, face detection, OCR run simultaneously across GPU/ANE/CPU
- Batched face embeddings: single ONNX call for N faces
- In-memory CLIP: eliminated temp file I/O
- Metal concurrency fix: shared gpu_lock prevents MLX + Vision crashes
- 29 tests

## 0.1.0–0.1.8 — 2026-03-23 to 2026-03-30

Initial release and iterations. Custom thumbnail worker, ffmpeg proxy, ML service. See git history for details.
